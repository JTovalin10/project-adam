# Hi, I'm Justin ðŸ‘‹

## ðŸš€ Current Focus: Project Adam

Building systems software from first principles over 20 months.

From data structures to ARM hypervisors - [View the full roadmap â†’](https://github.com/JTovalin10/project-adam)

**Current Project:** Data Structures & Algorithms Library  
**Goal:** Master systems programming and become cracked  
**Timeline:** Oct 2025 - June 2027  
```

## **MY RECOMMENDATION: Do BOTH Option 1 and 3**

### **Here's the setup:**

1. **Create `project-adam` repository** - Full README with all details
2. **Update your profile README** - Summary pointing to project-adam repo
3. **GitHub Projects** - Use for task tracking with descriptions from the 16 projects I gave you

## **VISUAL STRUCTURE:**
```
Your GitHub Profile
â”œâ”€â”€ Profile README (github.com/username/username)
