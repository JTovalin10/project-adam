# Evolution: Networking Primitives & Advanced Algorithms - Detailed Timeline

**Duration:** Jan 1 - Feb 28, 2026 (59 days)  
**Work Schedule:** 1 hour/day average  
**Total Hours Available:** 59 hours

---

## Overview

**Network-focused phase** that builds primitives and algorithms directly used in Mastery phase's networking projects (DNS, UDP, TCP). This phase prioritizes practical networking knowledge over academic algorithms.

## Project List

- [ ] **Bloom Filter** - Probabilistic data structure for fast membership testing (used by DNS Server for ad-blocking) | 3-4 hours | Jan 1-4, 2026
- [ ] **Ring Buffer (Circular Buffer)** - Fixed-size circular buffer for packet buffering and producer-consumer patterns | 3-4 hours | Jan 5-8, 2026
- [ ] **Radix Tree (Patricia Trie)** - Compressed trie for IP routing tables and longest prefix match | 6-8 hours | Jan 9-16, 2026
- [ ] **Skip List** - Probabilistic alternative to balanced trees with simple implementation | 4-5 hours | Jan 17-21, 2026
- [ ] **Sliding Window Protocol** - TCP flow control mechanism for reliable data transmission (used by TCP from Scratch) | 4-5 hours | Jan 22-26, 2026
- [ ] **CRC32 / Internet Checksum** - Packet integrity validation algorithms (used by UDP and TCP) | 2-3 hours | Jan 27-29, 2026
- [ ] **Token Bucket Algorithm** - Rate limiting and traffic shaping for network congestion | 3-4 hours | Jan 30 - Feb 2, 2026
- [ ] **Exponential Backoff** - TCP retransmission and congestion control algorithm (used by TCP from Scratch) | 2-3 hours | Feb 3-5, 2026
- [ ] **Consistent Hashing** - Distributed hash table for BitTorrent and distributed systems (used by BitTorrent Client) | 4-5 hours | Feb 6-10, 2026
- [ ] **Bellman-Ford Algorithm** - Distance-vector routing algorithm (like RIP protocol) | 5-6 hours | Feb 11-16, 2026
- [ ] **Fibonacci Heap** ⭐⭐⭐ Capstone - Advanced heap structure optimizing Dijkstra's algorithm | 15-20 hours | Feb 17-28, 2026

**Total Estimated Time:** ~51-67 hours

## Notes

- Fibonacci Heap is the most challenging project in this phase - amortized analysis masterclass
- This phase is intentionally lean and focused—cutting academic algorithms (dynamic programming, advanced graph theory) in favor of networking primitives
- All projects directly prepare for Mastery phase's networking projects (DNS, UDP, TCP)
- Bloom Filter will be used in DNS Server for ad-blocking
- Consistent Hashing will be used in BitTorrent Client for DHT
