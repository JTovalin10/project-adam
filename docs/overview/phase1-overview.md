# Phase 1: The Basics - Overview

**Duration:** Oct 24, 2025 - Jan 10, 2026 (78 days)
**Work Schedule:** 1 hour/day average
**Total Hours Available:** 127 hours

## Overview

Phase 1: The Basics builds essential data structures, algorithms, and networking primitives that form the foundation for all subsequent systems projects.

This phase focuses on **C++ implementation mastery**: correct syntax, robust testing, and manual memory management (pointers, `new`/`delete`). The goal is to understand how these data structures work internally. For data structures with existing industry-standard libraries (e.g., `std::vector`, `std::unordered_map`), production code in later phases will use those libraries. These Phase 1 implementations are educational references only—they will not be used in production code.

Data structures covered in CSE 332 (Data Structures & Parallelism) and CSE 421 (Algorithms) are excluded unless directly used in planned projects. CSE 422 (Advanced Toolkit for Modern Algorithms) covers complementary topics like sketching algorithms, sampling, and ML algorithms.

The phase is organized into two focus areas:

### Core Data Structures (Oct 24 - Nov 11, 2025)

Fundamental data structures for C++ implementation mastery and manual memory management practice.

### Networking Primitives (Nov 12, 2025 - Jan 10, 2026)

Network-focused data structures and algorithms directly used in Phase 3's networking projects (DNS, UDP, TCP).

## Code Standards

All time estimates include:
- Project setup (`.h`, `.cpp`, `gtest.cpp`, `makefile`)
- Comprehensive unit testing (GoogleTest)
- Header file documentation following the [Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html)

## Core Data Structures Projects

**Projects:** Dynamic Array, Singly LinkedList, Doubly LinkedList, Stack, Queue, Hash Table, Trie, LRU Cache, **Red-Black Tree** ⭐

**Total Estimated Time:** ~30-35 hours
**Available Time:** 68 days × 1 hour/day = 68 hours

> Min Heap, Dijkstra's Algorithm, and Union-Find are excluded because they are covered in CSE 332/421.

---

## Networking Primitives Projects

**Data Structures:** Bloom Filter, Ring Buffer, Skip List
**Algorithms:** CRC32/Internet Checksum, Token Bucket, Leaky Bucket, Exponential Backoff, Bellman-Ford, **Sliding Window Protocol** ⭐

**Total Estimated Time:** ~38-50 hours
**Available Time:** 60 days × 1 hour/day = 60 hours

> Radix Tree and Consistent Hashing are excluded. Radix Tree is not needed for later phases, and Consistent Hashing will be covered in CSE 422.
