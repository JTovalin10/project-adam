# Phase 1: Foundation - Overview

**Duration:** Oct 24, 2025 - Feb 28, 2026 (127 days)  
**Work Schedule:** 1 hour/day average  
**Total Hours Available:** 127 hours

## Overview

Phase 1: Foundation builds the essential data structures, algorithms, and networking primitives that form the foundation for all networking and systems projects. This phase is split into two parts:

### Phase 1a: Genesis - Data Structures and Algorithms (Oct 24 - Dec 31, 2025)

Building essential data structures and algorithms with **C++ implementation mastery**: correct syntax, robust testing, and manual memory management (pointers, `new`/`delete`). I have taken CSE 332 (Data Structures & Parallelism) and will take CSE 421 (Algorithms) at UW, so algorithms and data structures covered in those courses are not included here unless they're directly used in projects I'll build.

### Phase 1b: Evolution - Networking Primitives & Advanced Algorithms (Jan 1 - Feb 28, 2026)

Network-focused phase that builds primitives and algorithms directly used in Phase 2's networking projects (DNS, UDP, TCP). This phase prioritizes practical networking knowledge over academic algorithms.

## Code Standards

All time estimates include:
- Project setup (`.h`, `.cpp`, `gtest.cpp`, `makefile`)
- Comprehensive unit testing (GoogleTest)
- Header file documentation following the [Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html)

## Phase 1a Projects

**Data Structures:** Dynamic Array, Singly LinkedList, Doubly LinkedList, Stack, Queue, Hash Table, Min Heap, Trie, LRU Cache, **Red-Black Tree** ⭐ Capstone

**Algorithms:** Dijkstra's Algorithm, Union-Find / Disjoint Set

**Total Estimated Time:** ~50-60 hours  
**Available Time:** 68 days × 1 hour/day = 68 hours

## Phase 1b Projects

**Networking Data Structures:** Bloom Filter, Ring Buffer, **Radix Tree** ⭐ Capstone, Skip List

**Networking Algorithms:** Sliding Window Protocol, CRC32/Internet Checksum, Token Bucket, Exponential Backoff, Consistent Hashing, Bellman-Ford

**Total Estimated Time:** ~36-47 hours  
**Available Time:** 59 days × 1 hour/day = 59 hours

## Phase 1 Total

**Total Estimated Time:** ~86-107 hours  
**Available Time:** 127 days × 1 hour/day = 127 hours
