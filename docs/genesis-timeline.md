# Phase 1a: Genesis - Data Structures and Algorithms - Detailed Timeline

**Duration:** Oct 24 - Dec 31, 2025 (68 days)  
**Work Schedule:** 1 hour/day average  
**Total Hours Available:** 68 hours

---

## Overview

Building essential data structures and algorithms that form the foundation for all networking and systems projects. This phase focuses on **C++ implementation mastery**: correct syntax, robust testing, and manual memory management (pointers, `new`/`delete`). I have taken CSE 332 (Data Structures & Parallelism) and will take CSE 421 (Algorithms) at UW, so algorithms and data structures covered in those courses are not included here unless they're directly used in projects I'll build.

**Note:** All time estimates include project setup (`.h`, `.cpp`, `gtest.cpp`, `makefile`), comprehensive unit testing (GoogleTest), and header file documentation following the [Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Notes

- Skipping basic sorting/searching algorithms (Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Binary Search) as these are already mastered from NeetCode
- Red-Black Tree is the most challenging project in this phase - self-balancing requires careful rotation logic
- All projects include comprehensive unit testing (GoogleTest), memory leak checking, and header file documentation per Google C++ Style Guide
- Each project builds understanding for networking and systems programming
