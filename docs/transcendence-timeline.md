# Phase 3: Perfection - The World - Detailed Timeline

**Duration:** Jan 2027 - June 2027 (6 months, ~181 days)  
**Work Schedule:** 1 hour/day average  
**Total Hours Available:** ~181 hours

---

## Overview

Distributed systems and virtualization. Building the capstone project: an ARM hypervisor running multiple Linux VMs on Raspberry Pi 5. Like Adam Warlock's perfection—the ultimate creation.

---

## Project List

- [ ] **BitTorrent Client** - P2P file-sharing with Distributed Hash Table (uses Consistent Hashing from Evolution) | 40-50 hours | Jan 1 - Feb 19, 2027
- [ ] **Custom Memory Allocators** - Buddy, slab, and pool allocators for efficient memory management (used by ARM Hypervisor) | 30-40 hours | Feb 20 - Mar 31, 2027
- [ ] **ARM Hypervisor** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Capstone - Type-2 hypervisor running multiple Linux VMs (uses Custom Memory Allocators) | 80-100 hours | Apr 1 - Jun 30, 2027

**Total Estimated Time:** ~150-190 hours

## Notes

- ARM Hypervisor is the capstone project spanning 3 months
- BitTorrent Client uses Consistent Hashing from Evolution phase for DHT
- Custom Allocators prepare for hypervisor memory management
- All projects build toward the hypervisor
- The hypervisor represents the ultimate systems programming achievement—creating virtual worlds
