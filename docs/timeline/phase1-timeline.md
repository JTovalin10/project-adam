## Phase 1 Total Progress
**Completed:** 13/19 projects  
**Total Estimated Time:** ~68-85 hours  
**Available Time:** 127 hours

## Notes
- All time estimates include project setup (`.h`, `.cpp`, `gtest.cpp`, `makefile`), comprehensive unit testing (GoogleTest), and header file documentation per Google C++ Style Guide
- Phase 1a focuses on C++ implementation mastery and foundational data structures with emphasis on manual memory management
- Phase 1b focuses on networking primitives that directly prepare for Phase 2
- Skipping Min Heap, Dijkstra's, and Union-Find - Min Heap and Dijkstra's were covered in CSE 332, and Union-Find doesn't provide additional C++ memory management practice
- Skipping Consistent Hashing and Radix Tree - Consistent Hashing will be covered in CSE 422 (Advanced Toolkit for Modern Algorithms) HW1
- CSE 422 will cover modern algorithmic techniques like sketching algorithms (count-min sketch), similarity search, dimension reduction, PCA, SVD, spectral graph theory, and MCMC - complementing this low-level systems focus
- Thread-safe versions of data structures will be implemented later for networking projects in Phase 2
- Red-Black Tree and Sliding Window Protocol are the capstone projects for each sub-phase
